# Welcome to Workday Countdown

Hey there! I'm Peter from Germany, and I built this during... well, let's say during my lunch breaks (definitely not on company time, I swear! 😅).

## Why I Made This

You know that feeling when you're sitting at your desk, watching the clock, wondering "How much longer until I can go home?" Yeah, me too. So instead of constantly checking the time and doing mental math, I decided to build something that would do it for me.

## What It Does

This little tool keeps track of your workday and shows you exactly how much time is left until your next break or until you can finally escape... I mean, finish work for the day.

## Getting Started

1. **Set up your schedule**: Click "rules" at the bottom and tell it when you start, when you finish, and when you take breaks.
2. **Make it pretty**: Hit the theme button to find something that doesn't make you want to cry.
3. **Switch views**: Toggle between seeing your total time left or just time until your next break (sometimes you need the small victories).

## What's Inside

- Real-time countdown that updates every second (because every second counts when you're waiting to leave)
- Progress bar showing how much of your day is done (very satisfying to watch)
- Different rules for different days (because Mondays and Fridays are not the same)
- Nice themes with daily Bing images (at least something pretty to look at)
- Break tracking (seriously, take your breaks!)

## Pro Tips from Someone Who Watches the Clock Too Much

- Set up different rules for each weekday - your schedule probably isn't the same every day
- Actually use those break reminders - your sanity will thank you
- Try the different themes until you find one that sparks a tiny bit of joy
- The timer updates every second, so you can watch your freedom approach in real-time

Hope this helps make your workdays a bit more bearable. We're all just trying to make it to 5 PM, right?


Peter
